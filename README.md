How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future? To make programs easy to use, I keep my code organized in small functions. I use clear names for everything and write comments to explain what I did. I follow coding rules and handle errors well. I also write tests to check if the code works. Using the CRUD Python module is helpful because I can reuse it, which saves time. It keeps the database code separate and makes it easier to manage. This also speeds up my work.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests? When I solve problems, I first understand what the client needs. Then, I look for possible solutions and make a simple example. After that, I build the solution step by step and make changes based on what is needed.For the Grazioso Salvare project, I worked closely with what the client wanted.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better? Computer scientists create software that helps businesses work better. Their work is important because it brings new ideas, makes processes faster, and helps businesses make good decisions.
